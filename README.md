# SpatialOritentationPractice
 A Unity Project for practicing the Spatial Orientation Test commonly found in Pilot and ATC assessments. After finishing the core functionality, being able to complete questions, may extend (eg: adding an answer checker, or adding complexity to questions that you would not find in any of the assessments) 

The Spatial Orientation Test consists of questions where there are 2 compasses - a gyrocompass (GYRO) and a radiocompass (RBI). 
The GYRO represents the direction a plane is travelling, with the compass rotating around a representation of the plane such that the top of the compass is always the direction the plane is travelling.
